# Memory-Card

Memory card game based off of Odin Project curriculum. Player is presented with multiple cards and must select a previously unselected card to increment score. Failure to do so will restart the game. Live demo can be found on github.io [here](https://sasountorossian.github.io/Memory-Card/).

Project was a continuation of React.js tutorial, but with newly introduced lifecycle methods and hooks. After an initial rough patch, project was set up in relatively short order. Majority of project time was spent on cleaning up code and design.

Decided to use Material-UI again in order to make the project presentable, and make use of the Cards module to create individual cards for the game. Animations were done using framer-motion, though they are still quite basic and do not make use of framer-motions full potential.

Quick and easy project to learn hooks and lifecycle methods.
